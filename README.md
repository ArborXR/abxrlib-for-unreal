## Sending Data

### Event Methods
```cpp
//C++ Event Method Signatures
public static void Event(const FString& Name);
public static void Event(const FString& Name, TMap<FString, FString>& Meta);

// Example Usage - Basic Event
UAbxr::Event(TEXT("button_pressed"));
```
**Parameters:**
- `name` (FString): The name of the event. Use snake_case for better analytics processing.
- `meta` (TMap<FString, FString>): Optional. Additional key-value pairs describing the event.

Logs a named event with optional metadata and spatial context. Timestamps and origin (`user` or `system`) are automatically appended.

### Event Wrappers (for LMS Compatibility)
-The LMS Event Functions are specialized versions of the Event method, tailored for common scenarios in XR experiences. These functions help enforce consistency in event logging across different parts of the application and are crucial for powering integrations with Learning Management System (LMS) platforms. By using these standardized wrapper functions, developers ensure that key events like starting or completing levels, assessments, or interactions are recorded in a uniform format. This consistency not only simplifies data analysis but also facilitates seamless communication with external educational systems, enhancing the overall learning ecosystem.

#### Assessments
Assessments are intended to track the overall performance of a learner across multiple Objectives and Interactions. 
* Think of it as the learner's score for a specific course or curriculum.
* When the Assessment is complete, it will automatically record and close out the Assessment in the various LMS platforms we support.

```cpp
//C++ List Definition
enum EEventStatus
{
    Pass,
    Fail,
    Complete,
    Incomplete,
    Browsed
}

//C++ Event Method Signatures
public static void EventAssessmentStart(const FString& AssessmentName, TMap<FString, FString>& Meta)

public static void EventAssessmentComplete(const FString& AssessmentName, int Score, EEventStatus Status, TMap<FString, FString>& Meta)

// Example Usage
UAbxr::EventAssessmentStart(TEXT("final_exam"));
UAbxr::EventAssessmentComplete(TEXT("final_exam"), 92, EEventStatus.Pass);
```

#### Objectives
```cpp
//C++ Event Method Signatures
public static void EventObjectiveStart(const FString& ObjectiveName, TMap<FString, FString>& Meta)

public static void EventObjectiveComplete(const FString& ObjectiveName, int Score, EEventStatus Status, TMap<FString, FString> Meta)

// Example Usage
UAbxr::EventObjectiveStart(TEXT("open_valve"));
UAbxr::EventObjectiveComplete(TEXT("open_valve"), 100, EventStatus.Complete);
```

#### Interactions
```cpp
//C++ List Definition
public enum EInteractionType
{
   Null, 
   Bool, // 1 or 0
   Select, // true or false and the result_details value should be a single letter or for multiple choice a,b,c
   Text, // a string 
   Rating, // a single digit value
   Number, // integer
   Matching,
   Performance,
   Sequencing
}

//C++ Event Method Signatures
public static void EventInteractionStart(const FString& InteractionName, TMap<FString, FString>& Meta)

public static void EventInteractionComplete(const FString& InteractionName, EInteractionType InteractionType, const FString& Response, TMap<FString, FString> Meta)

// Example Usage
UAbxr::EventInteractionStart(TEXT("select_option_a"));
UAbxr::EventInteractionComplete(TEXT("select_option_a"), EInteractionType.Select, TEXT("true"));
```

### Other Event Wrappers
#### Levels
```cpp
//C++ Event Method Signatures
public static void EventLevelStart(const FString& AssessmentName) 

public static void EventLevelComplete(const FString& LevelName, int Score)
public static void EventLevelComplete(const FString& LevelName, int Score, TMap<FString, FString> Meta)

// Example Usage
UAbxr::EventLevelStart(TEXT("level_1"));
UAbxr::EventLevelComplete(TEXT("level_1"), 85);

// For flagging critical training events (e.g., skipped safety checks, high-risk errors) for auto-inclusion in the Critical Choices Chart
public static void EventCritical(const FString& Label)
public static void EventCritical(const FString& Label, TMap<FString, FString>& Meta)
```

**Note:** All complete events automatically calculate duration if a corresponding start event was logged.

---

### Logging
The Log Methods provide straightforward logging functionality, similar to syslogs. These functions are available to developers by default, even across enterprise users, allowing for consistent and accessible logging across different deployment scenarios.

```cpp
//C++ Event Method Signatures
public static void LogDebug(const FString& Message)
public static void LogInfo(const FString& Message)
public static void LogWarn(const FString& Message)
public static void LogError(const FString& Message)
public static void LogCritical(const FString& Message)

// Example usage
UAbxr::LogError(TEXT("Critical error in assessment phase"));
```

---

### Telemetry
The Telemetry Methods provide comprehensive tracking of the XR environment. By default, they capture headset and controller movements, but can be extended to track any custom objects in the virtual space. These functions also allow collection of system-level data such as frame rates or device temperatures. This versatile tracking enables developers to gain deep insights into user interactions and application performance, facilitating optimization and enhancing the overall XR experience.

To log spatial or system telemetry:
```cpp
//C++ Event Method Signatures
public void TelemetryEntry(const FString& Name, TMap<FString, FString>& Meta)

// Example usage
UAbxr::TelemetryEntry(TEXT("headset_position"), TMap<FString, FString> { {TEXT("Host"), TEXT("api.example.com")}, {TEXT("Port"), TEXT("443")}, {TEXT("Scheme"), TEXT("https")} });
```

**Parameters:**
- `Name` (string): The type of telemetry data (e.g., "OS_Version", "Battery_Level", "RAM_Usage").
- `Meta` (TMap<FString, FString>): Key-value pairs of telemetry data.
